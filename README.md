# Devo Tower Instructions

A collection of lessons and instructions about coding principles.

## Motivation 

I've been a programming instructor at a University summer camp for years.  I love teaching programming and when some friends were struggling to learn JavaScript I started writing "a few hints" and it turned into this.  

Some day when my coding projects aren't taking so much of my time, I have a list of topics I'd like to add to this collection.

## Contribute

If you wish to contribue branch off of master and submit a PR.
